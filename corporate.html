      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>We have come up with three different objectives for our campaign:</p>
		<ul>
		 <li><strong>Reach objective:</strong> Through means of our social media campaign we want to reach 1,000 total impressions across all platforms we are active on.</li>
			<li><b>Affect objective:</b> Have people reconsider that you don't need to share hobbies to from a meaningful relationship, and that our product supports that.</li>
			<li><b>Response objective:</b> Create fans of our brand that share our vision and want to express that they embrace differences.</li></ul>
		
		<p> The campaign that was executed was all about showing people that it's great to be seeking out things that are just a bit different, so not the standard so to speak. Our campaign message ''Embrace yourself, and others'' means that it's important to love yourself but also not to neglect ones who are different.
		</p>
		
		<p>Our target group is female, ranging between 18 to 25 years old. Income of these individuals is across the board quite low, estimated to be below € 20,000 a year. For this reason we priced our sneakers at € 74.99 which is below the well-known premium brands, but also not extremely cheap. We tried to strike a balance there.</p>
		
		<p>The chosen platforms for our campaign were Instagram and Facebook. This is because of our target group being most active on both of them and they offer extensive analysis tools on the performance of your posts. They also make it easy to post and don't require laborious video production like TikTok does for example.</p>
		
		<p>Instagram and Facebook have been used to post content regularly to try and generate a following and create impressions on people. As a new brand it turned out that this was quite difficult however.</p>
		
		<p>The plan was to have 8 posts on each platform by the end of the campaign but due to group issues this didn't quite go as planned on Facebook.</p>
		
      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      
		<p>This project has really taught us how important planning is. The content schedule was a rather neglected part of the campaign and it caused us to run into issues near the end of the project. To make matters worse, one of our teammates dropped out who managed the Facebook side of things without sharing the logins with us. So it was a huge scramble to get things done in time and even then unfortunately it didn't turn out as well as it could have.</p>
		
		<p>As a side effect of the group issues and not being able to communicate well with that group member, the content on the Facebook page doesn't match completely with our brand vision. Some pictures even include shoes that do not feature our design while they're meant to.</p>
		
		<p>So making a concrete schedule for content is crucial for next time and when creating brand accounts make sure everyone involved has access to it. That way the issues mentioned before can be easily avoided.</p>
		
		
		<p>We also underestimated the amount of work it takes to create original content. For most post we used stock images (of course with proper licensing) but it took a while to edit them to resemble our product for example. This is another factor that caused delays from our scheduled posting routine. So it is a good idea to start working ahead to make sure you have some of your posts pre-made beforehand.</p>
		
		<p>Perhaps as an accumulation of all of these factors, we did not meet our objective of reaching 1,000 impressions. The other goals we're unsure about as they are quite difficult to measure, we'd have to conduct research and interview people for that.</p>
		
	  <p>Some data from the Instagram page:
		<ul><li>Reached 51 accounts, of which 22 were followers.</li>
		<li>A total of 7 comments and 31 likes.</li>
			<li>A total of 33 followers.</li></ul></p>
		<p>So that's quite a ways off the goal but it's worth noting that we didn't spend any money on advertising. This is all organic. For us it was quite surprising to see that we reached more accounts of people who didn't follow us than people who did follow us.</p>
	  
	  <p>Another notable thing is that some spam accounts popped up near the end of the project, telling us to have our brand promoted by another massive account. Strangely enough the people commenting were different each time. Seems like shady business so naturally we didn't bite. It's possible that the statistics from non-followers being so high is because of spam accounts visiting our page.</p>
		
		
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>So far we have just been trying to find our footing, but with that out of the way there are some things we have learned which we can apply in future activities. It appears that out of the posts we have, the ones with pictures of people tend to gain more attention. So we would recommend to stick with that rather than corporate images of for example logos.</p>
      <p>Our Facebook page would need a relaunch to move forward as there is a bunch of content on there that's not in-line with our brand identity. Which again is a result of group issues. And of course the problem that we currently don't have access to it.</p>
      <p>As of yet we have left Instagram stories unexplored so we would to delve into that deeper if given the opportunity. Many popular brand accounts use it to drive engagement and share fun interactive content. Which can really create a loved brand, of course that's what every brand strives for. Looking into TikTok for campaign activities is also a good option as it also matches well with our target audience, we passed on it this time due to the difficulty of producing original video content.</p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
      <p>Below are all our promotional activities across our two chosen platforms; being Instagram and Facebook. <b>Clicking on the posts will take you to the account!</b></p>
